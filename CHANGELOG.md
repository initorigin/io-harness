# Changelog

All notable changes to **IO Harness** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**This file is the single source of truth for release notes.** When a release is
cut, the notes for that version are taken verbatim from its section below, so
keep every entry clear, user-facing, and complete. See
[docs/CHANGELOG_STRUCTURE.md](docs/CHANGELOG_STRUCTURE.md) for the required
structure and [docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md) for how release
notes are produced from it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

Trust a longer run: budgets, retry, a full trace, resumable runs, and
execution-based verification that compiles the produced file so a substring stub
cannot pass.

### Added

- Execution-based verification: `Verification::CompilesRust` (the produced file
  must compile) and `Verification::RustTestPasses { test_src }` (it must compile
  and pass an appended test). Compilation runs `rustc` in a throwaway temp dir
  with no network, closing the 0.1.0 hole where a substring stub passed
  `FileContains`.
- Step, time, and cost budgets on `TaskContract` — `with_time_budget`,
  `with_token_budget` (cost is counted in tokens), and the existing
  `with_max_steps` — each with a distinct stop reason:
  `RunOutcome::TimeBudgetExceeded` and `RunOutcome::CostBudgetExceeded`.
- Retry with escalation: `with_max_retries` retries a failing provider/tool
  step, records every attempt in the trace, then escalates the error.
- Full trace: each step now persists its prompt, tool call, and token usage
  alongside the decision and result (`StepRecord`).
- `resume(contract, provider, store, run_id)` continues an interrupted run from
  its persisted state under the original run id instead of restarting.
- `Usage` (prompt/completion/total tokens) on `CompletionResponse`, populated
  from the OpenRouter stream usage summary.

### Changed

- `Store::record_step` replaced by `Store::record(run_id, &StepRecord)`; the
  `steps` table gains `prompt`, `tool_call`, and `tokens` columns and migrates a
  0.1.0 database in place on open.
- `Verification::check` (sync) replaced by `Verification::passes(path, contents)`
  (async), since execution-based gates run a compiler.
- `CompletionResponse` gained a `usage` field; construct it with
  `..Default::default()` for forward compatibility.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

First working slice: run one AI agent from a typed task contract to a verified
file edit, in-process.

### Added

- `TaskContract` — typed goal, target file, constraints, verification criterion,
  and step cap.
- Orchestration loop (`run`) — observe, reason, act, verify, stop; stops on the
  first passing verification or when the step cap is reached
  (`RunOutcome::Success` / `RunOutcome::StepCapReached`).
- Deterministic verification layer — `Verification::FileContains` and
  `Verification::FileEquals`. Deterministic (no model in the loop), so results
  are reproducible. Note: these are **content checks only** — they confirm the
  expected text is present, not that the artifact compiles or is semantically
  correct, so a model can satisfy a substring without meeting full intent.
  Execution-based verification is planned for 0.2.
- Filesystem tool — reads the target file into context, writes the agent's edit
  back; a missing file reads as empty so the agent can create it.
- Provider-agnostic `Provider` trait with no vendor type in the public API, and
  an `OpenRouter` implementation over an own HTTP + SSE client that parses
  streamed tool-call fragments. Credentials read from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`;
  model from `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (no default guessed).
- Run state in rusqlite (`Store`) — steps, decisions, and intermediate results
  persisted and read back for audit.
- End-to-end integration test (mock provider) and a live OpenRouter example.

### Security

- OpenRouter API key is read from the environment and never logged or committed.
