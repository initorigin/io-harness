All notable changes to **IO Harness** are documented in this file.

**This file is the single source of truth for release notes.** When a release is
cut, the notes for that version are taken verbatim from its section below, so
keep every entry clear, user-facing, and complete. See
[docs/CHANGELOG_STRUCTURE.md](docs/CHANGELOG_STRUCTURE.md) for the required

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

First working slice: run one AI agent from a typed task contract to a verified
file edit, in-process.

### Added

- `TaskContract` — typed goal, target file, constraints, verification criterion,
  and step cap.
- Orchestration loop (`run`) — observe, reason, act, verify, stop; stops on the
  first passing verification or when the step cap is reached
  (`RunOutcome::Success` / `RunOutcome::StepCapReached`).
- Deterministic verification layer — `Verification::FileContains` and
  `Verification::FileEquals`. Chosen over a model-judged check so a run cannot
  pass a file that does not meet the spec.
- Filesystem tool — reads the target file into context, writes the agent's edit
  back; a missing file reads as empty so the agent can create it.
- Provider-agnostic `Provider` trait with no vendor type in the public API, and
  an `OpenRouter` implementation over an own HTTP + SSE client that parses
  streamed tool-call fragments. Credentials read from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`;
  model from `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (no default guessed).
- Run state in rusqlite (`Store`) — steps, decisions, and intermediate results
  persisted and read back for audit.
- End-to-end integration test (mock provider) and a live OpenRouter example.

### Security

- OpenRouter API key is read from the environment and never logged or committed.
